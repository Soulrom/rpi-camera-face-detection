RASPBERRY PI 4 B - CAMERA STREAM WITH FACE DETECTION
Easy Setup Guide for Beginners

==============================================================================
WHAT IS THIS?
==============================================================================

This is a complete camera streaming system that runs on Raspberry Pi 4 B. 
It provides:
  - Live video stream of your IMX290 camera
  - Real-time detection of faces (green boxes)
  - Web interface you can view in any web browser
  - High performance (28 FPS on Raspberry Pi 4B)
  - Simple setup (5 minutes)

==============================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED
==============================================================================

Hardware:
  - Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB minimum, 4GB recommended)
  - IMX290 IR-CUT camera module
  - 5V/3A power supply
  - Micro SD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed
  - Network connection (WiFi or Ethernet)

Software:
  - This camera system (Camera folder)
  - SSH client on Windows (OpenSSH included in Windows 10/11)
  - Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

Knowledge Required:
  - None! This guide is step-by-step for complete beginners

==============================================================================
QUICK START (5 MINUTES)
==============================================================================

STEP 1: Find Your Raspberry Pi's IP Address

On your Raspberry Pi (via monitor) or router admin panel:
  Example: 192.168.1.100

STEP 2: Copy Files from Windows

Open PowerShell on Windows (Win+R, type: powershell, Enter):

  scp -r C:\Users\mokri\OneDrive\Desktop\Camera pi@192.168.1.100:~/

When prompted for password, type: pi (default password)

STEP 3: Install on Raspberry Pi

Open Command Prompt and SSH into Pi:

  ssh pi@192.168.1.100

When prompted, type the password: pi

Now type these commands:

  cd ~/Camera
  sudo bash install.sh

When prompted for password, type: pi

This takes 5-10 minutes. The script will:
  - Download and install necessary programs
  - Set up the camera
  - Configure everything automatically

Installation is complete when you see:
  > [SUCCESS] Installation complete!

STEP 4: Reboot

Type:
  sudo reboot

Wait 2 minutes for the system to restart.

STEP 5: View Your Camera

Open your web browser and go to:
  http://192.168.1.100:5000

You should see:
  - Live camera video
  - Green boxes when faces are detected
  - FPS counter

Done! Your camera system is now running.

==============================================================================
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
==============================================================================

The camera system is now:
  - Running live video stream at ~28 FPS
  - Detecting faces in real-time
  - Serving video on port 5000
  - Accessible from any device on your network

To view on other devices (phone, laptop):
  1. Find another device on your WiFi network
  2. Open web browser
  3. Go to: http://192.168.1.100:5000

==============================================================================
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
==============================================================================

Issue: Can't access http://192.168.1.100:5000

Solution:
  1. Check Pi is on: ping 192.168.1.100
  2. Wait a few seconds and try again
  3. Check if service is running:
     ssh pi@192.168.1.100
     sudo systemctl status camera-rtsp.service
  4. If it's not running:
     sudo systemctl start camera-rtsp.service

Issue: Installation failed

Solution:
  1. Check your internet connection
  2. The system may have used a different package manager
  3. Try manual installation (see DEPLOY.md)
  4. If errors continue, check TROUBLESHOOTING.md

Issue: Camera doesn't show video

Solution:
  1. Make sure camera ribbon is fully connected
  2. Enable camera in settings:
     sudo raspi-config
     Select: Interface Options → Camera → Enable
     Reboot
  3. Test if camera works:
     libcamera-hello --list-cameras

Issue: Faces are not being detected

Solution:
  1. Lighting: Make sure area is well lit
  2. Distance: Face should be at least 20x20 pixels
  3. This is normal - Haar Cascade works best in profile view
  4. Adjust detection settings in config.json if needed

==============================================================================
PERFORMANCE
==============================================================================

On Raspberry Pi 4B, you should see:
  - Video: 25-30 FPS
  - CPU: 40-60% usage
  - Memory: ~400 MB
  - Faces: Green boxes around detected faces
  - Latency: Less than 100ms network delay

If performance is slow:
  1. This is normal on first boot (system optimizing)
  2. Wait a few minutes for system to stabilize
  3. Check temperature: vcgencmd measure_temp
  4. If too hot, make sure case has airflow

==============================================================================
MAKE IT AUTO-START
==============================================================================

So the camera starts automatically when Pi boots:

  ssh pi@192.168.1.100
  cd ~/Camera
  sudo systemctl enable camera-rtsp.service
  sudo reboot

Now whenever you power on the Pi, the camera automatically streams!

To stop it:
  sudo systemctl stop camera-rtsp.service

To check if it's running:
  sudo systemctl status camera-rtsp.service

==============================================================================
VIEW LOGS (ADVANCED)
==============================================================================

To see what the system is doing:

  ssh pi@192.168.1.100
  sudo journalctl -u camera-rtsp.service -f

This shows real-time logs. Press Ctrl+C to exit.

You'll see:
  - Camera initialization
  - FPS measurements
  - Face detection counts
  - Any errors

==============================================================================
IMPORTANT PASSWORDS AND DEFAULTS
